You probably already have checked it out, if not, here's how to do it:

git clone http://github.com/dirkz/NetHack-iOS.git

How to build

cd win/iOS
sh bootstrap

Load win/iOS/NetHack-iOS/NetHack-iOS.xcodeproj with a stable
xcode. Don't use beta / preview versions of xcode! You might have to
change the base SDK to the latest SDK you have installed, e.g. to
4.1. Internally, the iOS Deployment Target is set to iOS 3.0, so you
can stay compatible to the release.

If you now set your target to debug and simulator the project should
build. Warnings can be ignored unless they are in the UI code.

This worked 2010-10-05 with xcode 3.2.4 / iOS 4.1 (Dirk)
